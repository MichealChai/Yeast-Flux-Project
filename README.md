## 	1. Simulation for k_app in the linear pathway
To get accurate estimation, we simulated the labeling fraction with different values of _r_ ($k_x/k_y$), and fit single exponential to obtain _k<sub>Y_app</sub>_. In this code, we compared the fitted _k<sub>app</sub>_ with the curve of the equation $k_{app}=k_X*k_Y/(k_X+k_Y)$, and the result shows that they are very similar.
